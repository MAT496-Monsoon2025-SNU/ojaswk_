      "==================================================\n",
      "Answer: Based on the information provided in the research documents, the main steps to enroll in a course are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Search for courses:\n",
      "   - The Course Catalog provides a detailed listing of all courses offered at the university, including course codes, titles, prerequisites, credit hours, and departmental offerings (Source 2, Source 3).\n",
      "   - You can use the ERP system to search for and view available courses (Source 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Add the course to your Wishlist:\n",
      "   - On the course detail page, you can click \"Next\" to add the course to your Course Wishlist (Source 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Proceed with enrollment:\n",
      "   - Access your Course Wishlist by clicking on the \"Enroll\" tab (Source 4).\n",
      "   - Click \"Proceed to Step 2 of 3\" to review the course information (Source 4).\n",
      "   - Click \"Finish Enrolling\" to attempt enrolling in the course (Source 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Review enrollment status:\n",
      "   - You will be directed to the \"View Results\" section, where you can see if the course has been successfully added to your timetable (Source 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note the relevant enrollment dates, such as the last date to add or drop courses, as mentioned in Source 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you need to repeat or improve your grade in a course that has been replaced with a new course code under the new curriculum, a specific method for doing so will be defined and communicated by the Office of the Dean of Academics (Source 6).\n",

      "Question: What are the key requirements for a minor?\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Answer: Based on the provided research documents, the key requirements for a minor at UWE are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. UWE SWAYAM courses offered by your own major department are not allowed to be taken for the minor (Source 1, Page 19).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Only majors of a department may take its SWAYAM Major Electives for credit towards the minor (Source 1, Page 19).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Some Major Electives are year-specific, meaning they are only open to students in certain years (e.g., only 3rd or 4th year) (Source 1, Page 19).\n",
      "\n",
      "The research documents do not provide comprehensive details on other potential requirements for a minor, such as the number of credits required or any specific course prerequisites. The information is limited to the restrictions mentioned above. If more details are needed, further research or clarification from the university would be required.\n",

      "Question: How does the grading change on a per code basis\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Answer: Based on the information provided in the research documents, the grading changes on a per course code basis in the following ways:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Repeating Courses with Updated Course Codes:\n",
      "   - If a student needs to repeat or improve their grade in a course that has been replaced with a similar course under a new course code, they will take the course under the same old course code (Source 1).\n",
      "   - The classes for these repeated courses will be held jointly with the first-year batch under the new curriculum (Source 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Grade Replacement:\n",
      "   - When repeating a course, the new grade will entirely replace the old grade, regardless of whether it is higher or lower (Source 2).\n",
      "   - The previous course's credits and grade will not be counted towards the student's academic record (Source 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Course Type Restrictions:\n",
      "   - There are restrictions on the type of courses that can replace each other, such as CCC courses can only be replaced with other CCC courses (Source 2).\n",
      "   - These course type restrictions are clearly listed in the Undergraduate Handbook (Source 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. SWAYAM Course Replacements:\n",
      "   - SWAYAM courses can only be replaced by other SWAYAM courses, and a separate replacement form is released for these cases (Source 2).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Grade Improvement Eligibility:\n",
      "   - Students can only retake a course for grade improvement if it was originally taken within the last three semesters (Source 3).\n",
      "   - For older courses, the student will require approval from both the department and the course instructor (Source 3).\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to note that the research documents do not provide information on the grading changes for major changes or SWAYAM course submissions, so the analysis is limited to the information available in the provided sources.\n",

      "RESEARCH SUMMARY\n",
      "==================================================\n",
      "Based on the research documents provided, the key findings regarding ERP usage and course enrollment can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Key Findings and Conclusions:\n",
      "   - The university's ERP system provides a comprehensive set of tools to help students plan and manage their academic journey, including the Course Catalog, Planner, Course Wishlist, and Academic Requirements (Sources 2, 3).\n",
      "   - The ERP system allows students to search for courses, add or drop courses, and finalize their course enrollment and timetable (Source 1).\n",
      "   - Students must ensure that they have cleared all outstanding fees and have no active holds on their ERP account before they can register for courses (Source 4).\n",
      "   - If a course clashes with a student's existing timetable, they can request an attendance waiver from the course instructor or contact the Office of the Dean of Academics (Source 5).\n",
      "   - From Monsoon 2025 onwards, students can self-enroll in SWAYAM online courses directly through the ERP system during the registration period (Source 6).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Methodological Approaches:\n",
      "   - The research documents provided do not explicitly mention any specific methodological approaches used. They appear to be informational guides and instructions on how to use the university's ERP system for course enrollment and planning.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Conflicting Results or Debates:\n",
      "   - The research documents do not present any conflicting results or debates. They provide a consistent and coherent overview of the ERP system's features and the course enrollment process.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Gaps in Current Research:\n",
      "   - The research documents do not provide any insights into the user experience or satisfaction with the ERP system, nor do they explore any challenges or limitations faced by students during the course enrollment process.\n",
      "   - There is no information on the development or implementation of the ERP system, or any evaluation of its effectiveness in improving the course enrollment experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the research documents provide a comprehensive overview of the ERP system's features and the step-by-step course enrollment process, but do not delve into the methodological approaches, conflicting results, or gaps in the current research on this topic.\n"
