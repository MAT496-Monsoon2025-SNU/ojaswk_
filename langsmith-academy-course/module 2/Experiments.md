## Experiments

Python notebook: [experiments.ipynb](resources/experiments.ipynb)

This video explains how to set up and run experiments using your datasets and evaluators. It covers best practices for comparing different models, prompts, or configurations.

Experiments let you systematically compare different versions of your LLM application.

You can track which changes lead to improvements and which introduce regressions.

Running experiments on the same dataset ensures fair and consistent comparisons.
