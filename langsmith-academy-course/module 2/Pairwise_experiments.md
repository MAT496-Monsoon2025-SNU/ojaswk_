## Pairwise Experiments

This video introduces pairwise experiments, where two models or configurations are compared directly on the same set of inputs. It explains how to set up and interpret pairwise comparisons.



Pairwise experiments let you see which model performs better on a case-by-case basis.

This approach is useful for A/B testing and fine-tuning.

You can use pairwise results to guide model selection and deployment decisions.
