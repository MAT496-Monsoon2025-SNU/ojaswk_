## Analyzing experiment results

This section teaches how to interpret and analyze the results of your experiments. It covers metrics, visualizations, and how to identify areas for improvement.
We go through the UI and how to use the built-in metrics and visualizations.

Analyzing experiment results helps you understand where your model is strong and where it needs work.

Look for patterns in the data, such as consistent errors on certain types of inputs.

Visualizing results makes it easier to communicate findings to your team.
